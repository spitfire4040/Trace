Data_Collector

This program will prompt for a starting date and a number of days to collect, and will collect all traceroutes, IP addresses, unique traceroutes, unique IP addesses, unique edges, IP counts, trace counts, and statistics from RIPE NCC, Caida's Archipelago (Ark) project, Measurement Lab (M-Lab), and the University of Washington's Information Plane (iPlane). Data is sorted by date in files that are formatted in a consistent manner. There are several dependencies, which will be evident when you attempt to run. (I will outline these later). The program runs in a C language wrapper, but calls several .cpp and .py files along the way, some of which need to be compiled ahead of time. Adjustments will need to be made to the file paths to match your system...this will be fixed later to make it more generic.
